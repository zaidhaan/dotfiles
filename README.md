# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. This repository is currently only meant to be used by me (so I can safely make changes and revert back as necessary). I might eventually document this better and add screenshots so it's useful to others. (At the moment the only things useful to an outsider might perhaps be my `.zshrc` or `.xmonad/xmonad.hs`)

## TODO:
- [ ] secure `.muttrc` and add
- [ ] figure out how to deal with weechat and its gargantuan configs
- [ ] (long-term) move `~/*` to `~/.config/`
