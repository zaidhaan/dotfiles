# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. This repository is currently only meant to be used by me (so I can safely make changes and revert back as necessary). I might eventually document this better and add screenshots so it's useful to others. (At the moment the only things useful to an outsider might perhaps be my `zsh/.zshrc` or `xmonad/xmonad.hs`)

## Screenshots
